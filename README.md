# Welcome to my Portfolio Page! 

Everything about me and my work can be found on the site itself. However if you want to hear my thoughts on coding and the process I went through, please feel free to scan the comments left in the html and css files. I pride myself with honest and open communication, and a promise to you as the customer that you know what is contained in the product you receive. 

To help you navigate here is a blurb about each page on my site: 

## Home

If you are a TLDR kind of person as I am, this is the page for you. The best introduction is a short one.

## Contact Me

Please do! I would love to hear anything you feel like is worth telling me. Positive, constructive, even negative can be good is it can lead to something I can improve on. I would love to hear about your ideas and help make them a reality.
